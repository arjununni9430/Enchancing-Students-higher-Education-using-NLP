# Enchancing-Students-higher-Education-using-NLP
In today's globalized world, an increasing number of students are seeking higher education opportunities abroad. However, choosing the right destination for studying abroad can be a daunting task, influenced by various factors such as cost of living, quality of education, cultural experiences, and personal preferences. This project aims to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Sentiment Analysis to enhance the process of selecting educational destinations for students. By analyzing textual data from sources such as student forums, social media, surveys, and professional networks, the project seeks to identify sentiments and preferences associated with different countries. The dataset includes information on 54 countries, including sentiment-labeled comments, cost of living, and quality of education. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), the project aims to provide valuable insights and recommendations to students, guiding them in making informed decisions about their educational journey abroad. This project not only demonstrates the application of NLP and machine learning in the educational domain but also contributes to empowering students with data-driven tools for optimizing their educational experiences.
